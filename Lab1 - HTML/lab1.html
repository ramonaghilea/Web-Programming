                    <h2>The Piano</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>The piano </b>is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori 
                        around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers 
                        that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). 
                        It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or strikes with 
                        the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.

                        Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys, 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale 
                        (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further 
                        back on the keyboard. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches (or "notes"), going from the 
                        deepest bass range to the highest treble.

                    <h2>Playing and technique</h2>
                    <p>
                        As with any other musical instrument, the piano may be played from written music, by ear, 
                        or through improvisation. While some folk and blues pianists were self-taught, in Classical 
                        and jazz, there are well-established piano teaching systems and institutions, including pre-college 
                        graded examinations, university, college and music conservatory diplomas and degrees, ranging from the B.Mus. 
                        and M.Mus. to the Doctor of Musical Arts in piano. Piano technique evolved during the transition from harpsichord 
                        and clavichord to fortepiano playing, and continued through the development of the modern piano.

                        The Italian pianist premiered this beautiful piece in Svalbard to publicise Greenpeace’s battle to save the Arctic.
                        In June 2016, Greenpeace persuaded the Italian composer and pianist to play on a specially built ‘iceberg’ within 100m of a 
                        crumbling glacier as part of their campaign to save the Arctic.
                        In the video, Einaudi is seen performing his minimalist music in the breathtakingly beautiful surroundings of 
                        Wahlenbergbreen glacier in Svalbard, Norway. As he plays one descending scale, huge chunks of ice calve off the glacier.

                            To get to the spectacular location, Einaudi caught a ride with the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise.
