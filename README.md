# Web-Programming
My projects for the Web Programming Course studied at the University


### Lab 1 - HTML
Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like (e.g. personal home page, photo collection, movie stars, cars etc.).

### Lab 2 - CSS Simple
10. Write a web page which contains a horizontal line in the middle of the page. The top side of the page should be colored with a red based gradient which should be fully transparent in the middle of the screen. The bottom side of the page should be colored with a blue based gradient which should be fully transparent in the middle of the screen.

23. Write a web page which contains a div with a blue background color located on the top left corner of the page. When the mouse is over it the div should move to the bottom right corner of the page. The div should not jump directly to the bottom right corner. During this transition, the background color of the div should transition from blue to full red.

### Lab 3 - CSS Layouts
Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://twitter.com/twitter. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.) and you are not allowed to use any css or javascript library.

### Lab 5 - Javascript
Write a javascript which will be used in an html document that contains a tabel with 3 columns and several lines. When the user clicks the table header the script will sort in ascending order the elements from the current column. If the user clicks again on the column header, the elements will be sorted in descending order.

### Lab 6 - Jquery
Write a web page which contains a table with 10 lines and 4 columns. The table should also have a column header and a column footer. When the user clicks on a cell from the header, the table content will be sorted in ascending order of the cells from the column that the user has clicked on. If the user clicks again on the header cell from that column, the table will be sorted again, but in descending order of the cells from that column. If the user clicks on a footer cell from column i, than the cells from column i will be interchanged with the cells from the column i+1 (if i+1=5, the first column is interchanged with column 4).

### Lab 7 - PHP, AJAX, JSON
In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP. The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables and should implement the following base operations on these tables: select, insert, delete, update. Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously from the web server and the web application should contain at least 5 web pages (client-side html or server-side php).

Write a web application for managing log reports. The log reports are registered (added) by users to a database repository. A log report has several attributes: type, severity (i.e. debug, warning, notice, error, critical etc.), a date, a user who created the log and the log itself (message text). A user must have the posibility to view log reports added by him/her, all log reports, logs of a specific type or severity (use AJAX for this). Also a user can delete his/her own log report. Log browsing should be paged - logs are displayed on pages with maximum 4 logs on a page (you should be able to go to the previous and the next page).

### Lab 8 - PHP, Angular
Develop an Angular UI (user interface) for the PHP lab task you have solved for Lab7. So, the problem you need to solve for this lab will be the same problem you had for Lab7 (PHP, Ajax, JSON), the backend of the solution will be the same (i.e. the php code), but you have to change the frontend (html, css, javascript part) to be an Angular application.

### Lab 9 - JSP, Java Servlets
Develop a web application based on JSP (Java Server Pages) or Java Servlets.
All web pages should be accessible only if the user logs in using a username and a password (create a session each time a user logs in, and destroy the session when the user logs out).

Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. Write a web application for a forum. Users must identify themselfs prior to entering the forum. Each user can start a new topic or can comment (post) on an existing topic. Each user must be able to delete its own posts (comments). The posts of a topic should be displayed in a single web page.

### Lab 10 - ASP.NET
Develop a web application based on ASP .NET.
All web pages should be accessible only if the user logs in using a username and a password (create a session each time a user logs in, and destroy the session when the user logs out).

Solve the same problem you got for the PHP lab, but using the ASP .NET technology. In addition to the specification for the PHP lab, your application must implement user authentication and ask the user to authenticate himself/herself prior to actually using the web application (based on an username and password saved in the database).
