# Web-Programming
My projects for the Web Programming Course studied at the University


#### Lab 1
Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like (e.g. personal home page, photo collection, movie stars, cars etc.).

#### Lab 2
10. Write a web page which contains a horizontal line in the middle of the page. The top side of the page should be colored with a red based gradient which should be fully transparent in the middle of the screen. The bottom side of the page should be colored with a blue based gradient which should be fully transparent in the middle of the screen.

23. Write a web page which contains a div with a blue background color located on the top left corner of the page. When the mouse is over it the div should move to the bottom right corner of the page. The div should not jump directly to the bottom right corner. During this transition, the background color of the div should transition from blue to full red.

#### Lab 3
Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://twitter.com/twitter. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.) and you are not allowed to use any css or javascript library.
